# Festdetails
Our project is all about developing a User friendly Website which is a complete view of campus festivals of Indian colleges.

Information part
Here we categorize fests by type (like technical, cultural and sports and others), by college name, by location (like States or major cities). User can get the details of fests searching by type, college, department, state and major city. we also provide latest upcoming events and have a proper update. Also a separate link for the new fests. Each and every fest and college will be another link when user click the link, details about that particular fest will be provided with both pros and cons of fest and college fests.
